# final

<br>
<p>This is our team code for the final project. We selected project #12. This project involves building an ice-breaker question generator to help people get past small-talk during Zoom calls. Users will be able to log in, browse our questions, and save the ones they like best to their profile. <p>
<p>Our team members: Christian Nikolopoulos, Jenieri Cyrus, Spencer Johnson.<p>
